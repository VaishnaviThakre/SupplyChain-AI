### **Memory Builder**  

1. **Document Processing**: Adds relevant documents (manuals, reports, etc.) to create a knowledge base.  
2. **Chunking**: Splits large text into manageable pieces for efficient processing.  
3. **Embeddings**: Converts chunks into vector representations, stored in a vector database like Chroma.  

### **RAG ChatBot**  

1. **Query Handling**: Accepts user queries and refines them based on chat history.  
2. **Context Retrieval**: Extracts the most relevant data from the embedding database.  
3. **Answer Generation**: Combines context with the query to deliver accurate responses.
